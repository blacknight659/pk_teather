teather application for Pentax cameras

# Use at your own risk!
With this software it is possible to damage your camera equipment. I am not responsible for any damages that may occur when using this software. I am NOT the creator of this software. PK_teather is currently difficult to find online and I am hosting it via my GitHub page. I claim no rights to this software and am only sharing for the broader community who may still use older Pentax cameras and lenses and require this software to modify configuration files on your equipment.
